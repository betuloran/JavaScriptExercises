## Second Project 💻

## Fifth Project 💻
>### How does it work?

## Sixth Project 💻
>### How does it work?
#### When the menu icon is clicked, the JavaScript code toggles the showSidebar class on the sidebar, making it slide into view. Clicking the close (X) button inside the sidebar removes the showSidebar class, hiding the sidebar again. This provides a simple and effective way to show or hide the sidebar with smooth animations.

## Seventh Project 💻
>### How does it work?
#### updateRate function fetches the latest exchange rate for the selected currency. When the user selects a different currency or changes the amount, the updateRate function recalculates the equivalent value in the target currency. The exchange rate and calculated amount are updated instantly in the display areas, giving the user up-to-date conversion information.
